To make sure your users can access your customer portal and consume your services, you need to set up at least one authentication method.

Kobble provides a variety of login providers:

- Email provider (such as Magic Link)
- Social login providers (Google, GitHub, GitLab, Microsoft, etc.)


## Core concepts

### Auth Applications

In general, you want to use your Kobble Customer Portal as an authentication method from your application, website or GPT plugin.

To do so, you need to create an Auth Application in your Kobble dashboard.

This will give you a `client_id` and `client_secret` that you can use to authenticate your users.

### Authentication flow

1. A user clicks on the "Login" button on your website, application or GPT.
2. The user is redirected to your Customer Portal, where they can choose a login provider.
3. Once signed in, the user is redirected back to your website, application or GPT with an access token.
4. Then the access token is used to make requests your API through the Kobble Gateway.
5. Kobble will monitor every request and make sure the user is authorized to access your API.

## Configuring Login Providers

You can easily configure login providers from your Kobble dashboard.

1. Navigate to your Kobble dashboard
2. Look for the settings icon located in the bottom left menu.
3. Find and click on the "Authentication" tab under the "Customer Portal" section.
4. Choose the login provider(s) you wish to enable for your portal.

<Note>Even if it could be tempting to enable all the providers, it's better to start with one or two. This will help you keep your configuration simple and avoid potential issues. Also note that OAuth providers such as Google will provide more information such as the profile image and the full name of the user.</Note>

### Email provider

Generally, there's minimal configuration needed. You can set this up quickly without any additional steps.

### Social providers

You'll need to visit the chosen provider's settings page to generate a "Client ID" and "Client Secret." Once obtained, input these details into the corresponding fields in your Kobble dashboard's provider configuration section.
