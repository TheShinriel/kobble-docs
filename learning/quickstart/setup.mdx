## Let's get started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign in to Kobble">
        [Sign up](https://app.kobble.io/register) or [Sign in to your kobble Dashboard](https://app.kobble.io/login).

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a new project">
        If you just signed up, you will be prompted to create a new project.

        If you are already logged in, click on your active project name and then click on `Create New Project`.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Authentication">
        Click on the `Authentication` tab in the left sidebar.

        Select the provider you want to use for authentication.

        You can choose from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, or Email and more.

        Configure and enable the provider you want to use.

        <Note>For more info specific to each provider, check out the [Authentication](/product/authentication/overview) section.</Note>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a Kobble Application">
        Open the Applications tab in the left sidebar.

        Click on `Create New Application`.

        Fill in the required fields and click on `Create Application`.

        At this stage you most likely don't know your Redirect URL, so you can leave it empty for now.

        If you know your Redirect URL, you can fill it in now.
