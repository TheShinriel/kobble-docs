title: 'Parse token'
---

As explained in the [gateway section](/product/gateway), every request forwarded by the Gateway will contain a Bearer Token.

This token is formed as a JWT and contains the user's information.

The `parse_token` method helps you parse/verify this token and extract the user's information.

If the token is valid, the method will return an object with the user's information.

If the token is invalid, the method will throw an error.

## Example usage

```python
payload = await kobble.gateway.parse_token(token)
```

## Return value

If the token is valid, the function will return a promise of the payload matching the following type:

```python
@dataclass
class TokenPayload:
    project_id: str
    user: TokenPayloadUser

@dataclass
class TokenPayloadUser:
    id: str
    email: Optional[str]
    name: Optional[str]
    products: List[TokenPayloadProduct]

@dataclass
class TokenPayloadProduct:
    id: str
    quotas: List[TokenPayloadQuota]

@dataclass
class TokenPayloadProduct:
    id: str
    quotas: List[TokenPayloadQuota]
```
