title: Auth Middleware
---

Kobble provides a built-in auth middleware that you can use to protect your routes from unauthenticated users.

## Usage

To use the auth middleware, just create a file named `middleware.ts` in the `src` directory of your project and add the following code:

```typescript
import { authMiddleware } from "@kobbleio/next/server";

export default authMiddleware({
  publicRoutes: ["/(.*)"],
});

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // exclude internal Next.js routes
    "/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)",
    // reinclude api routes
    "/(api|trpc)(.*)",
  ],
};

```

All routes defined in the `publicRoutes` array will be accessible without authentication.

## Routes Matcher

Often, you may want to use path parameters or wildcard to match multiple routes. Here is an example of matchers that you can use.

### Wildcard

You can use `(.*)` to match all routes under a specific path.

Examples:

- `"/(.*)"`: Matches all routes under the root path.
- `"/public/(.*)"`: Matches all routes under the `/public` path.
- `/something/:user*`: Matches all routes under the `/something/:user` (e.g. `/something/john`, `/something/john/doe`, etc).

### Path parameters

You can use the `:param` notation to match a path parameter with a given name.

Examples:

- `"/categories/:category"`: Matches all routes under the `/categories` path with a path parameter `category`.
- `"/categories/:category/posts/:post"`: Matches all routes under the `/categories` path with two path parameters `category` and `post`.

<Note>Path named parameters must use "word characters" ([A-Za-z0-9_]) and start with a colon `:`</Note>

### Advanced path parameters

You can use more advanced patterns to match path parameters with specific format.

Examples:

- `/something/:user*`: Matches all routes under the `/something/:user` (e.g. `/something/john`, `/something/john/doe`, etc).
- `/something/(\\d+)`: Matches all routes under the `/something` path with a path parameter that must be a number.
- `/something/:number-(\\d+)`: Matches all routes under the `/something` path with a path parameter that must be a number and start with `number-`.
- `/something/(public|p)`: Matches all routes under the `/something` path with a path parameter that must be either `public` or `p`.
