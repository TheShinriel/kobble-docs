The `<SignedIn>` component allows you to show content only when the user is signed in.]]

### Props

<ParamField path="children" type="ReactNode">
    The content to show when the user is signed in.
</ParamField>

### Examples

```tsx
import { SignedIn } from "@kobbleio/next/client";

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <SignedIn>
            <span>Your're authenticated</span>
        </SignedIn>
    );
}
```

It can be used in combination with the `<SignedOut>` component to show different content based on the user's authentication status.

```tsx
import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from "@kobbleio/next/client";

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <>
            <SignedIn>
                <span>Your're authenticated</span>
            </SignedIn>
            <SignedOut>
                <span>Your're not authenticated</span>
            </SignedOut>
        </>
    );
}
```
