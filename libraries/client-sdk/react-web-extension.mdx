<Note>Pre-requisites: You need to [set up your Kobble account](/learning/quickstart/setup).</Note>

## Suggested boilerplate

Although there are many Chrome Extension boilerplate available on GitHub, we figured many of them just don't work.

So we suggest you use [Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite)

## Install the SDK

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install @kobbleio/react-web-extension">
        Install the @kobbleio/react-web-extension sdk with the provider of your choice.

        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash npm
            npm install @kobbleio/react-web-extension
            ```

            ```bash yarn
            yarn add @kobbleio/react-web-extension
            ```

            ```bash pnpm
            pnpm add @kobbleio/react-web-extension
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Use the KobbleProvider">
        To use the SDK, you must wrap your Popover or Tab component with the `KobbleProvider` component.

        Here's an example taken from our Chrome Extension boilerplate.

        ```tsx
        import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
        import '@src/index.css';
        import Newtab from '@src/Newtab';
        import { KobbleProvider } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

        function init() {
            const appContainer = document.querySelector('#app-container');
            if (!appContainer) {
                throw new Error('Can not find #app-container');
            }
            const root = createRoot(appContainer);

            root.render(
                <KobbleProvider domain={'YOUR_KOBBLE_DOMAIN'} clientId={'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'}>
                    <Newtab />
                </KobbleProvider>
            );
        }

        init();
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Replace the KOBBLE DOMAIN and CLIENT ID">
        In the above snippet, don't forget to replace `YOUR_KOBBLE_DOMAIN` and `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Kobble domain and client ID.

        <Note>**KOBBLE_DOMAIN** and **KOBBLE_CLIENT_ID** can be found in your Kobble dashboard.</Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the right permissions to your manifest file">
       You need to make sure the `permissions` array of your `manifest.json` file contains at least the following permissions:

        ```json
        // manifest.json
        {
            "permissions": [
                "storage",
                "identity",
                "*://*.kobble.io/*",
                "tabs",
            ]
            // rest of the file...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start using our components">

        Unlike for a web application, you don't have to setup a callback handler.

        So we can directly use our components, here's an example.

        ```tsx
        import {LoginButton, LogoutButton, SignedIn, SignedOut} from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

        const Newtab = () => {
                return (
                <div>
                    <SignedIn>
                        <span>You are logged in</span>
                        <LogoutButton>Logout</LogoutButton>
                    </SignedIn>

                    <SignedOut>
                        <span>You are logged out</span>
                        <LoginButton>Login</LoginButton>
                    </SignedOut>
                </div>
            );
        };

        export default Newtab;
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Hooks

The SDK exposes many hooks that you can use to interact with the authentication state of your application.

### useAuth()

The `useAuth` hook allows you to get the authentication state of the user. Instead of using the `kobble` client instance, you can directly get the user object from the react context.

```tsx
import { useAuth } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
```

### useAuthStateChanged()

The `useAuthStateChanged` hook allows you to listen for changes in the authentication state of the user.

The callback function will be called with the user object when the user is signed in, and `null` when the user is signed out.

<Note>The callback may be called multiple times. For instance when you refresh the page it will be initially called with a `null` user and then the `User` object if authenticated.</Note>

```tsx
import { useAuthStateChanged } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

useAuthStateChanged((user) => {
    // user can be null or a User object
    console.log('Auth state changed', user);
});
```

### useAccessControl()

The `useAccessControl` hook allows you to check if the user has the required permissions or quotas to access a specific resource.

<Note>You must attribute quotas and/or permissions to your Products from your [Kobble dashboard](https://app.kobble.io) for them to work.</Note>

#### Check permissions

```tsx
import { useAccessControl } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";
const { hasPermission } = useAccessControl();

const canGenerateImage = async () => {
    return hasPermission('generate-image');
}
```

#### Check remaining quotas

```tsx
import { useAccessControl } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";
const { hasRemainingQuota } = useAccessControl();

const canGenerateImage = async () => {
    return hasRemainingQuota('image-generated');
}
```

### useKobble()

The `useKobble` hook allows you to get the `kobble` client instance that exposes various utility methods.

#### Get user state

<Note>Even if you can do it using the Kobble instance we suggest you do it using the `useAuth` hook explained above.</Note>

```tsx
import { useKobble } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

const { kobble } = useKobble();

const anything = async () => {
    const user = await kobble.getUser();
    const isAuthenticated = await kobble.isAuthenticated();
};
```

#### Get access and ID tokens

```tsx
import { useKobble } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

const { kobble } = useKobble();

const anything = async () => {
    const accessToken = await kobble.getAccessToken();
    const idToken = await kobble.getIdToken();
};
```

#### Listen for state changes

The `onAuthStateChanged` method allows you to listen for changes in the authentication state of the user.

The callback function will be called with the user object when the user is signed in, and `null` when the user is signed out.

<Note>The callback may be called multiple times. For instance when you refresh the page it will be initially called with a `null` user and then the `User` object if authenticated.</Note>

```tsx
import { useKobble } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";
const { kobble } = useKobble();

kobble.onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
    // user can be null or a User object
    console.log('Auth state changed', user);
});
```


## Components

The SDK exposes a few components that you can use to interact with the authentication state of your application seemlessly.


### `<SignedIn>`

The `<SignedIn>` component allows you to show content only when the user is signed in.

```tsx
import { SignedIn, useAuth } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

const { user } = useAuth();

<SignedIn>
    <span>Welcome back, {user.name}</span>
</SignedIn>
```

### `<SignedOut>`

The `<SignedOut>` component allows you to show content only when the user is signed out.

```tsx
import { SignedOut } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<SignedOut>
    <span>Sign in to access more features</span>
</SignedOut>
```

### `<LoginButton>`

The `<LoginButton>` component allows you to show a button that triggers the login flow and redirects the user to your authentication portal.

You can use the component as it or pass it a child to customize it.

**Default usage:**

```tsx
import { LoginButton, SignedOut } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<SignedOut>
    <LoginButton />
</SignedOut>
```

**Custom usage:**

```tsx
import { LoginButton, SignedOut } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<SignedOut>
    <LoginButton>
        <button className="your-class-or-any-other-attribue">Login</button>
    </LoginButton>
</SignedOut>
```

<Note>The onClick event will automatically get handled by the SDK, don't pass any handler.</Note>

### `<LogoutButton>`

The `<LogoutButton>` component allows you to show a button that triggers the logout flow.

You can use the component as it or pass it a child to customize it.

**Default usage:**

```tsx
import { LogoutButton, SignedIn } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<SignedIn>
    <LogoutButton />
</SignedIn>
```

**Custom usage:**

```tsx
import { LogoutButton, SignedIn } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<SignedIn>
    <LogoutButton>
        <button className="your-class-or-any-other-attribue">Logout</button>
    </LogoutButton>
</SignedIn>
```

<Note>The onClick event will automatically get handled by the SDK, don't pass any handler.</Note>


### `<IsAllowed>`

The `<IsAllowed>` component allows you to show content only when the user has the required permissions or quotas to access a specific resource.

It takes a `permission` or `quota` prop that you can use to check if the user has the required permissions or quotas.

Both `permission` and `quota` props can be either a string or an array of strings.

```tsx
import { IsAllowed } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<IsAllowed permission="generate-image">
    <button>Generate Image</button>
</IsAllowed>
```

```tsx
import { IsAllowed } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<IsAllowed quota="image-generated">
    <button>Generate Image</button>
</IsAllowed>
```

### `<IsForbidden>`

The `<IsForbidden>` component allows you to show content only when the user doesn't have the required permissions or quotas to access a specific resource.

It takes a `permission` or `quota` prop that you can use to check if the user doesn't have the required permissions or quotas.

Both `permission` and `quota` props can be either a string or an array of strings.

```tsx
import { IsForbidden } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<IsForbidden permission="generate-image">
    <span>Sorry, you don't have the required permissions to generate an image</span>
</IsForbidden>
```

```tsx
import { IsForbidden } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<IsForbidden quota="image-generated">
    <span>Sorry, you've reached the maximum number of images you can generate</span>
</IsForbidden>
```

### `<ProfileLink>`

The `<ProfileLink>` component allows you to show a link to the user's profile of your Customer Portal.

It must take a child that will be used as the link text.

```tsx
import { ProfileLink, SignedIn } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

this

<SignedIn>
    <ProfileLink>My Profile</ProfileLink>
</SignedIn>
```

### `<PricingLink>`

The `<PricingLink>` component allows you to show a link to the pricing page of your Customer Portal.

It must take a child that will be used as the link text.

```tsx
import { PricingLink } from "@kobbleio/react-web-extension";

<PricingLink>View Pricing</PricingLink>
```
