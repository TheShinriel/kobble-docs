## Overview

Kobble allows you to monetize your content by creating products that can be sold to your customers.

### Products and Prices

![Products and Prices](/images/product-relations.jpg)

A `Product` is an item that you can sell to your customers at a given `Price`.

A Product wraps information such as a Name, a Description and a list of Features.

A `Price` can be configured to be a `one-time payment` or a `recurring subscription`.

You can configure multiple prices for a single product, allowing you to offer different pricing options to your customers (e.g. a monthly, yearly, etc.).

Your products will be displayed on your Customer Portal so that your customers can purchase them.

You don't have to write any code to start selling your products.

All your customers and payment will still be visible in your Stripe account so you can own your data and manage your customers as you wish later.

<Note>
    Kobble partners with Stripe to handle all payments. Having a valid Stripe account is prerequisite to use our service.
    At the moment, we do not, nor plan to, support any other payment gateway than Stripe.
</Note>

### Quotas

A `Quota` is a limit on the usage of a product. You can configure quotas to limit the usage of your products.

When a quota is reached for a customer, Kobble will automatically return a specific message containing a link to the payment portal so the customer can upgrade their plan.

<Note>
    By default, if no quotas are set, your customers will be able to use your products with no limit.
