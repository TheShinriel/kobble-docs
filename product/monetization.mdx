### Products and Prices

![Products and Prices](/images/product-relations.jpg)

A `Product` is an item that you can sell to your customers at a given `Price`.

A Product wraps information such as a Name, a Description and a list of Features.

You can configure multiple prices for a single product, allowing you to offer different pricing options to your customers (e.g. a monthly, yearly, etc.).

Your products will be displayed on your Customer Portal so that your customers can purchase them.

You don't have to write any code to start selling your products.


<Note>
    All your customers and payment will still be visible in your Stripe account so you can own your data and manage your customers as you wish later.
</Note>

### Quotas

Quotas are a way to meter and limit the usage of your application.

When a `Quota` is added to a `Product`, all customers subscribed to this product will be subject to the quotas you have defined.

### Permissions

Permissions are a way to control access to your application.

When a `Permission` is added to a `Product`, all customers subscribed to this product will be granted the permissions you have defined.
