Permissions are a way to control the access of your users to your app's features.

They are almost like quotas, but they are not limited by a number. Instead, they are boolean values that can be set to true or false.

When attached to a product, all users who subscribe to this product will inherit the permissions attached to it.

## Example

For example, if your app allows users to generate videos, you can create a permission called `generate-videos`.

Then, you can set the permission `generate-videos` to true for members on the premium plan and false for members on the free plan.

Then from your frontend code, you could display a button to generate videos only if the user has the permission `generate-videos` set to true.

Example code:

<CodeGroup>
    ```tsx Frontend example (React)
    import { IsAllowed, IsForbidden } from '@kobble/react';

    function App() {
      return (
          <IsAllowed permission="generate-videos">
            <button>Generate Video</button>
          </IsAllowed>
          <IsForbidden permission="generate-videos">
            <p>You need to upgrade to the premium plan to generate videos</p>
         </IsForbidden>
      );
    }
    ```

    ```tsx Backend example (Node.js)
    import { Kobble } from '@kobble/admin';

    const kobble = new Kobble('API_KEY');
    const userId = '123';
    // Check if the user has the permission to generate videos
    const isAllowed = await kobble.users.hasPermission(userId, 'generate-videos');
    ```
