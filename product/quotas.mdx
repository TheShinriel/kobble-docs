Quotas are a way to limit the usage of your products.

When attached to a product, all users who subscribe to this product will inherit the quotas attached to it.

## Example

For example, if your app is a photo edition app and you want to limit the number of generated images per month, you can create a quota called `generated-images` and attach it to your product.

Then, you can set the limit of the quota to:

- 10 generated images per month for members on the free plan
- 100 generated images per month for members on the premium plan

Then from your frontend code, you could display a button to generate images only if the user has remaining credits.

Example code:

<CodeGroup>
    ```tsx Frontend example (React)
    import { IsAllowed, IsForbidden, useAccessControl } from '@kobble/react';

    function App() {
        const { getQuota } = useAccessControl();
        const quota = getQuota('generated-images');

        return (
            <span>Usage: {quota.usage} of {quota.limit}</span>

            <IsAllowed quota="generated-images">
                <button>Generate Image</button>
            </IsAllowed>
            <IsForbidden permission="generated-images">
                <p>You need to upgrade to the premium plan to generate videos</p>
            </IsForbidden>
        )
    }
    ```

    ```tsx Backend example (Node.js)
    import { Kobble } from '@kobble/admin';

    const kobble = new Kobble('API_KEY');
    const userId = '123';
    // Check if the user has enough credit to generate images
    const isAllowed = await kobble.users.hasRemainingQuota(userId, 'generated-images');
    ```

    ```tsx Backend example (Go)
    package kobble

    import (
        "github.com/kobble-io/go-admin/kobble"
    )

    func main() {
        k := kobble.New("YOUR_SECRET_KEY", kobble.Options{})
        isAllowed, err := k.Users.HasRemainingQuota("USER_ID", []string{"event-handled"}, nil)
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }

        // Do something if the user has remaining quota
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Create a quota

To create a quota, visit the [Quotas](https://app.kobble.io/p/monetize/quotas) page.

Create a quota and name it idiomatically.

For example, if you want to limit the number of generated images per month, you can name it `generated-images`.

Then, you can set the limit of the quota for every product you want to apply it to.

Go to the [Products](https://app.kobble.io/p/monetize/products) page and click on the product you want to apply the quota to.

Then, click on the Quotas tab and select the quota you just created.

Now, every user who subscribes to this product will have this quota applied to them.

## Manipulate quotas

There are two ways to manipulate quotas:
- Programmatically using our [Admin SDK](/libraries/admin-sdk/node) or [Frontend libraries](/libraries/client-sdk) depending on your use case.
- Manually using the [Admin Console](https://app.kobble.io/p/users/view)

You can:
- Increase or decrease the limit of a quota for a specific user.
- Reset the limit of a quota for a specific user.
- Get the current usage of a quota for a specific user.
- Verify if a user has reached the limit of a quota.
