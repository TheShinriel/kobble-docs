## Overview

When you create a new project on Kobble, we'll provide you with a gateway URL.

It's the URL that your users will use to access your API.

As shown in the diagram below, the gateway will overload the initial user request with the following information:
- The user's Identity (name, email, userId) encoded in a signed token
- The user's Quota (how many requests the user can make per day, per month, etc.)
- The user's Plan (the product the user is subscribed to)

## Full scenario

When seeing the diagram above you're probably wondering how the user will authenticate at first.

The answer is simple: through the Customer Portal.

As shown in the diagram below, a normal scenario would be:

- The user will first get an authentication token from the Customer Portal.
- Then, every request made by the user to your API will go through the gateway and contain the authentication information.
- The gateway will then validate the user's request and forward it to your API.


Having all user requests go through the gateway allows us to provide you with all features related to monetization, analytics, and security.

<Note>The bearer sent at Step #2 won't be the same as the token you will receive in your API for security reasons.</Note>

## Protecting your API

In a normal scenario, all request made to your API will go through the gateway and so, will be validated.

However, nothing prevent a user to bypass the gateway and send a request directly to your API.

So you need to protect your API from direct requests.

To do so, you can use the following methods:

- **IP Whitelisting**: You can whitelist the gateway's IP addresses in your API. This way, only requests coming from the gateway will be accepted.
- **Token Validation**: You can validate the token sent by the gateway in your API. This way, only valud requests coming from the gateway will be accepted.

These methods are not mutually exclusive and you can use both of them to protect your API as shown in the following diagram.

### IP Whitelisting

The Kobble gateway will send requests to your API from the following IP addresses:

- 34.70.245.93
- 130.211.127.238
- 34.72.87.26

<Note>Note that these IP addresses can change overtime. Any change would be communicated by email and public announcement in our Discord community.</Note>


### Token Validation

The gateway will send a token with every request made to your API.

To learn how to validate the token in your API, please refer to the token validation documentation.
