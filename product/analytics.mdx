## Overview

Kobble will automatically track the requests made by your users and provide you with:

- a macro view of your users' behavior (retention, conversion, funnel, and more)
- a micro view of your users' behavior (individual user activity)

For each level of granularity, you will be able to get both business insights and technical insights.

Business insights are about understanding your users' behavior and how they interact with your product.

Technical insights are about understanding how your product is performing and how your users are interacting with it.
