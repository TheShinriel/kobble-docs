Designing an intuitive and user-friendly customer portal is key when building a SaaS. However, it's also a time-consuming and complex process that requires a lot of resources.

Kobble provides a built-in customer portal that allows your users to:

- Sign up or log in securely
- Explore pricing options, subscribe to services, and manage their subscriptions
- Access their profile, view invoices, and more

### How it works?

Our frontend SDKs allow you to redirect your users to the customer portal when needed (during the login process, for example).
The portal is hosted on a separate domain, which you can customize to match your brand's look and feel.

Then Kobble takes care of the rest, including:
- User authentication and session management
- Subscription management
- Stripe integration (you don't have to deal with Stripe's webhooks hell)
- Permission and Quota management


<Note>
    To guarantee that your customer portal functions flawlessly, it's crucial to set up an authentication method and define your pricing structure. The following sections will guide you through these essential steps.
