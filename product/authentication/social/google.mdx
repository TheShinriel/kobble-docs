Moreover, Google accounts provide more information about your users such as the name and profile picture.

To support Sign in with Google you need to configure the Google provider in the Kobble dashboard for your project.

Once configured, the Google sign-in button will automatically be added on your Kobble Customer Portal.

## Configuration
