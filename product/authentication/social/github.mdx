## Overview

Offering a sign in with GitHub in your Customer Portal can be great if you target a developer audience. It allows your users to sign in with their Github account and provides you with their email and profile picture.

To support Sign in with GitHub you need to configure the GitHub provider in the Kobble dashboard for your project.

Once configured, the GitHub sign-in button will automatically be added on your Kobble Customer Portal.

## Configuration

1. Open your Kobble Authentication Settings and choose the GitHub provider.
2. Copy the provided Redirect URI. Note this URI will change if you configure a custom domain later.

ðŸŽ‰ Et voilÃ ! Your customer can now use GitHub to sign-in in your authentication portal. No further action is required on your end.

<Warning>In case you change your Customer Portal domain later, you will have to go through this process again and update your Authorized Redirect URI in your GitHub configuration.</Warning>
