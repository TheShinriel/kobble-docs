description: Configure Azure AD OAuth for your Customer Portal.
---


## Overview

Offering a sign in with Azure AD in your Customer Portal may be a good idea for businesses that already use Microsoft services. It allows your users to sign in with their Microsoft account, which is convenient and secure.

To support Sign in with Azure AD you need to configure the Azure AD provider in the Kobble dashboard for your project.

Once configured, the Azure AD sign-in button will automatically be added on your Kobble Customer Portal.

## Configuration

1. Navigate to the [Authentication](https://app.kobble.io/p/authentication) section and choose the Azure AD provider.
2. Copy the provided Redirect URI. Note this URI will change if you configure a custom domain later.
