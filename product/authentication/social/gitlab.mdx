## Overview

Offering a sign in with GitLab in your Customer Portal can be great if you target a developer audience. It allows your users to sign in with their GitLab account and provides you with their GitLab profile.

To support Sign in with GitLab you need to configure the GitLab provider in the Kobble dashboard for your project.

Once configured, the GitLab sign-in button will automatically be added on your Kobble Customer Portal.

## Configuration

1. Navigate to the [Authentication](https://app.kobble.io/p/authentication) section and choose the GitLab provider.
2. Copy the provided Redirect URI. Note this URI will change if you configure a custom domain later.
