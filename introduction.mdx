## Why Kobble?

Whenever you're building an API or a SaaS platform, you always have to build the same things over and over again:

- user authentication
- payment processing
- analytics
- ∞ overthinking everything

Kobble is a platform that provides these features **out of the box**, so you can focus on building your product and launching it in minutes.

Our mission is to help you achieve product market fit faster.

With Kobble, you save (at least):

- +3 days building a customer portal
- +3 days dealing with Stripe pricing tables and webhooks and all this boring stuff.
- +4 hours to authenticate users
- +4 hours to set up your analytics funnel in Amplitude
- +2 days to build a robust permission system + quotas
- ∞ hours overthinking...

=> 7+ days of headaches saved (at very least)
