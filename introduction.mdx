## Why Kobble?

We have been building SaaS for years and we always repeated the same steps over and over again:

- add user authentication (using Firebase, Supbase, Auth0, etc.)
- connect Stripe and deal with their webhooks hell.
- build a customer portal to display pricing tables, invoices, etc.
- managing permissions of users frontend-side and backend-side depending on their subscription
- ∞ overthinking everything

Kobble is a platform that provides these features **out of the box** with SDKs that you can integrate in minutes.

**At Kobble we are on a mission to stop this madness and help you launch your product faster.**

Our mission is to help you achieve product market fit faster.

### How much time can I save?

With Kobble, you save (at least):

- +3 days building a customer portal
- +3 days dealing with Stripe pricing tables and webhooks and all this boring stuff.
- +4 hours to authenticate users
- +4 hours to set up your analytics funnel in Amplitude
- +2 days to build a robust permission system + quotas
=> 7+ days of headaches saved (at very least)
- ∞ hours overthinking...


### What does it look like?

It depends on the framework you are using but in a nutshell here's how it looks for a React app and a Node.js backend:

<CodeGroup>
    ```jsx Frontend side example
    import {
        SignedIn,
        HasPermission,
        HasRemainingQuota,
    } from '@kobbleio/react';

        return (
        <>
            <SignedIn>
                <HasPermission permission={'createImage'}>
                    <!-- Your code here -->
                </HasPermission>
                <HasRemainingQuota quota={'imageGenerated'}>
                    <!-- Your code here -->
                </HasRemainingQuota>
            </SignedIn>
        </>
        )
    ```
    ```jsx Backend side example
        import { Kobble } from '@kobbleio/admin';

        const kobble = new Kobble('api-key');

        const { userId } = await kobble
        .auth
        .verifyAccessToken('user-token')

        const user = kobble.user(userId)

        const hasPerm = await user.hasPermission(
        'generate-image'
        )

        const hasQuota = await user.hasRemainingQuota(
        'image-generated'
        )

        await user.incrementQuotaUsage(
        'image-generated'
        )
    ```
