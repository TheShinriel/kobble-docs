description: Monetize any GPT in 10 minutes using Kobble.
---

People have been waiting for GPT monetization for a long time.

OpenAI announced a revenue-sharing model that may sound unfair to many creators and lead the ecosystem in a winner-take-all situation.

At Kobble, our mission is to help any creator monetize an API and, consequently, any custom GPT.

In this tutorial we will show you how to monetize a GPT in 10 minutes using Kobble.

### What are we building?

In this tutorial, we will create a custom GPT that generates multiple images based on a single prompt.

To do so, we'll leverage the following providers:

- [Dezgo](https://dezgo.com/) text to image API
- [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/) storage API
- [Replit](https://replit.com/~) to store our API code (but you can store your API anywhere)
- [Kobble](https://kobble.io) to authenticate our users and monetize them
