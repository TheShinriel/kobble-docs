Adding Crisp to your customer portal is a great idea to get in touch with your customers, provide customer support and also enrich your CRM.

Kobble lets you add a custom script to your customer portal.

We'll see how you can use this feature to integrate Crisp and add the user's email, name and id to your favorite CRM.

## Pre-requisites

- A Crisp account
- Having a [customer portal](/product/customer-portal/overview) configured on Kobble

## Installation

1. Go to your [Crisp websites settings](https://app.crisp.chat/settings/websites/) dashboard
2. Click the **integration** button for the website of your choice and choose HTML
3. Copy the HTML snippet provided by Crisp

5. Paste the HTML snippet in the **Head HTML** field

6. Right after the Crisp snippet, add the following script to send the user's email, name and id to your CRM

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    if (kobble.user) {
        $crisp.push(["set", "user:nickname", [kobble.user.name]]);
        $crisp.push(["set", "user:email", [kobble.user.email]]);
    }
</script>
```

<Note>This snippet uses the `kobble.user` object to get the user's email and name and inject them into Crisp's CRM. You can find more information about the kobble.user object in the [Custom Scripts](/product/customer-portal/custom-scripts#accessing-users-data) section of this doc.</Note>

Et voil√†! Crisp is now integrated into your customer portal.
