description: 'Control your Kobble integration via the API.'
---

The Kobble API allows you to interact with your Kobble integration programmatically. You can use the API to perform a variety of tasks such as:
- Authenticate Gateway's requests
- Manage your users
- Verify the webhooks signature

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an API Key that you can generate from your [SDK secret tab](https://app.kobble.io/p/sdk/secrets) in your dashboard. You can pass the API Key in the `Kobble-Sdk-Secret` header as specified in the OpenAPI specification below.

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    Kobble-Sdk-Secret:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: Kobble-Sdk-Secret
security:
  - Kobble-Sdk-Secret: []
```
